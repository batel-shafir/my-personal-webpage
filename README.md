# :computer: My personal website :computer:

This is the code for my professional personal website. <br/>
You can check it out on [https://www.batelshafir.com](https://www.batelshafir.com).<br/>
I build it using React and material UI components.

## How to start?
* Clone the project.
* In the project directory, run "npm i" to install all required node modules.
* cd into the client directory, run "npm i" to install all required node modules.


## How to run the project? 
After you clone the files - in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode - server and client<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!
